# herdr-cc-tg-bridge

> Use the Claude Code sessions running in [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) from Telegram: one forum topic per session.

herdr-cc-tg-bridge connects a Telegram group (with Topics enabled) to the Claude Code sessions running in Herdr on your computer. What you drive from your phone *is* the session on your desk: same memory, same `CLAUDE.md`, same hooks and skills. Back at the computer, keep typing in the same Herdr tab.

**Codex support:** `/new codex name` starts Codex; `/new claude name` starts Claude. Existing Claude topics keep their behavior. Run `bin/tg-bind` inside a live Herdr Codex session to attach it. See [Codex setup and scope](docs/PRD-v3-codex.md).


It is a small Bun program with no runtime dependencies. The command it installs is called `tg-bridge`.

*Independent project. Not affiliated with, or endorsed by, Anthropic. It runs the unmodified Claude Code CLI under your own account.*

**中文说明见 [docs/README.zh-CN.md](docs/README.zh-CN.md)。**

## Get started

**You need:** a Mac (macOS 13 or later), a Claude plan that includes Claude Code (Pro, Max, Team, Enterprise, or a Console account), Telegram on your phone, and about 10 minutes. Linux should work but is untested.

### 1. Create a bot (1 minute)

In Telegram, open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), send `/newbot`, and pick a name and a username ending in `bot`. BotFather replies with a token like `123456789:AAH...`. Keep it private; use a new bot just for this.

### 2. Run the installer (about 3 minutes)

Open the Terminal app and paste:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KasparChen/herdr-cc-tg-bridge/main/install.sh | sh
```

It checks for Bun, Herdr and Claude Code, offers to install whatever is missing with their official installers, downloads this project to `~/.local/share/herdr-cc-tg-bridge`, and then asks for the bot token (typing is hidden).

### 3. Set up the group (about 3 minutes, while the installer waits)

1. Create a new group in Telegram and add your bot as a member.
2. In the group's settings (Edit), turn on **Topics**.
3. Still in the settings, open **Administrators**, add your bot, and switch on **Manage Topics**, **Pin Messages** and **Delete Messages**.
4. Send the line the installer shows, for example `/start@your_bot 482913`, in the group. The number is a one-time code for this install.

The installer then shows the group and the account it found. Type `y` if they are yours. Press Enter to keep the default session folder `~/tg-sessions`.

### 4. Log in and try it (2 minutes)

The installer ends by printing a line like this one. Run it, log in to Claude Code, choose to trust the folder when asked, then type `/exit`:

```sh
cd ~/tg-sessions && ~/.local/bin/claude
```

Now open the group. A pinned 🟢 message in General says the bridge is online. Send `/new` there: a new topic opens with a fresh Claude session. Write in that topic like you would in the terminal.

Each message you send gets a reaction that shows where it is: 👀 received, ✍ Claude is on it, 🤔 waiting for your choice, and the mark disappears once the answer is in. Send `/help` in a topic for every command.

### If something goes wrong

| What you see | What to do |
|---|---|
| `command not found: claude` or `herdr` in a new terminal | Open a new terminal window (the installer added `~/.local/bin` to your PATH), or use the full path `~/.local/bin/claude` |
| The installer keeps waiting for your group message | Check that the bot is in the group, Topics are on, and the message includes the code. Send it again |
| "The bot lacks the admin right ..." | Switch that right on in the group's Administrators settings, then press Enter |
| The pinned status is 🟡 with "Herdr unreachable" | Run `~/.local/bin/herdr` once. Needed again after every restart of the computer |
| A topic answers "The session is waiting for you" right away | Claude is asking whether to trust the folder. Run the line from step 4 once, or send `/keys enter` in the topic |
| Your message gets no reaction at all | The bridge did not receive it: the computer is asleep or offline, or the bridge stopped. Check with `~/.local/share/herdr-cc-tg-bridge/bin/tg-bridge status`; the log is `~/.tg-bridge/bridge.log` |
| You want to change the bot or the group | Run the installer again |

To remove it: `sh ~/.local/share/herdr-cc-tg-bridge/install.sh --uninstall` stops the background service and keeps your files.

**Good to know.** Only your Telegram account can use the bridge, and through Claude Code it can run commands on your computer, so keep the bot token private. The computer has to be on and awake: closing the lid puts it to sleep, and messages wait until it wakes. The installer is new; if it fails for you, please [open an issue](https://github.com/KasparChen/herdr-cc-tg-bridge/issues) with the terminal output. Prefer Chinese prompts? Add `-s -- --lang zh` after `sh`.

## What it looks like

Every turn shows up in the topic as one collapsible progress bubble that updates live, then the final answer:

```text
┃ ✅ Done                                     ← collapsed view: three lines
┃ 🔧 3 calls · 14s · ctx 27% (269k)            (status · tool calls · elapsed · context)
┃ ...
┃ 💬 Checking the OS version and disk space first.
┃ 💻 Running sw_vers
┃ 💻 Running df -h /
┃ 📖 Reading ~/project/.gitignore

macOS 15.7, 43 GiB free on /, .gitignore has 4 rules.   ← final answer
📎 ~/project/report.html                                ← files it created
```

## Features

- **Topic = session.** `/new name`, or creating a topic by hand, opens a new Claude session in a Herdr tab and binds it to the topic.
- **Hand over a desktop session.** Run `/tg-bind` inside a session you started on the computer: a new topic gets a handoff card and the last answer, and from then on both sides are in sync.
- **Full lifecycle from Telegram.** `/close` (or closing the topic in the client) ends the session and closes the topic; reopening it, or writing in it, resumes the same session. `/delete` removes topic and session. `/sessions` lists everything with buttons.
- **Live progress.** Tool calls stream into a folded bubble that is edited in place; the answer arrives as a separate message. Markdown becomes Telegram HTML, tables become bullet groups.
- **Files both ways.** Photos and documents you send are saved locally and handed to the session as paths. Deliverables the session writes are sent back automatically; anything else it can push with `tg-send`.
- **Questions as buttons.** A single-choice `AskUserQuestion` becomes inline buttons. Other prompts arrive as a screen capture you answer with `/keys`.
- **Context and limits.** Context use on every finished bubble, a one-time warning at 80%, and optional 5-hour / 7-day / per-model plan limits in the pinned status.
- **Stays up.** A supervisor restarts the bridge on crash, polling retries forever through network loss, a LaunchAgent starts it at login, and `caffeinate` keeps the Mac from idle-sleeping while it runs.

```

Three rules keep the design small:

1. **Herdr owns the sessions.** The bridge never runs Claude itself. It types into a session with `herdr agent prompt`, reads its state with `herdr agent get`, presses keys with `herdr pane send-keys`, and opens or closes tabs through Herdr. So the session on your desk and the one on your phone are the same process.
2. **Replies come from the transcript.** Claude Code writes every turn to a JSONL file. The bridge tails that file, so tool calls, text and titles arrive as structured events and the terminal's layout never gets in the way. The screen is read only to show a prompt that is waiting for input.
3. **One topic, one binding.** `state.json` maps each topic to a Herdr pane, its terminal id and the Claude session id. Herdr's Claude integration (`herdr integration install claude`) reports the session id, which is how the bridge finds the transcript.

### Components

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/main.ts` | Entry point and the long-polling loop |
| `src/router.ts` | Dispatches updates: commands, topic service messages, attachments, button taps |
| `src/lifecycle.ts` | Opens, resumes, binds (`tg-bind`), closes and deletes sessions; `/sessions`; detects deleted topics |
| `src/session.ts` | The Watcher: one per topic, polls Herdr every second, tails the transcript, renders the turn |
| `src/transcript.ts` | Incremental JSONL reader that turns lines into events (tool, text, title, end of turn) |
| `src/render.ts` | Progress bubble, Markdown to Telegram HTML, chunking under 4096 characters |
| `src/outbox.ts` | Which files written in a turn are sent back |
| `src/status.ts` | Liveness, the pinned status message, the Herdr workspace token |
| `src/usage.ts` | Context reading and plan-limit line |
| `src/telegram.ts` | Bot API client: timeouts, retries, 429 handling, topic probe |
| `src/herdr.ts` | Thin wrapper over the `herdr` CLI |
| `src/control.ts` | Local HTTP on 127.0.0.1: `/health`, `/send`, `/bind`, `/sim` |
| `src/store.ts` | `state.json`: update offset and topic bindings |
| `bin/tg-bridge` | Supervisor: restarts on crash, marks the status red, holds the `caffeinate` assertion |
| `bin/tg-send`, `bin/tg-bind` | Run inside a session: send files back, bind or unbind the session |
| `bin/install-launchd` | Installs the macOS LaunchAgent |

### What happens in one turn

1. You write in topic A. The router looks up the binding; if the pane is gone it resumes the session first (`claude --resume <id>`).
2. Attachments are downloaded to `~/.tg-bridge/inbox/<topic>/` and their paths are appended to the text, which goes in with `herdr agent prompt`.
3. Topic A's Watcher sees Herdr switch to `working` and reads new transcript lines. Tool calls go into the bubble, edited at most every 1.5 s.
4. When the transcript shows the end of the turn (an `end_turn` reply carrying text), the bubble is marked done with the context reading, the answer is sent, and files the turn wrote with the Write tool are sent back if their extension is on the list. Waiting for the transcript, not for Herdr's status, matters because background agents keep the session `working` long after the reply is done.
5. If Claude stops for input instead, a single-choice question becomes buttons; anything else is shown as a screen capture.

Text typed on the computer in a bound session shows up in the bubble with a 🖥 prefix, and its answer is sent to the topic too.

### Session lifecycle

| State | How it is reached | What the topic sees |
|---|---|---|
| live | Claude runs in the pane | normal conversation |
| exited | the pane is left with a shell (e.g. after `/exit`) | one notice with buttons: resume, start fresh, close |
| pane gone | the tab was closed on the computer | the same notice, once |
| closed | `/close`, or the topic closed in the client | one "session ended" line, then silence |
| deleted | `/delete`, or the topic deleted in the client | nothing; the binding is dropped |

Notices are recorded in `state.json`, so restarts never repeat them. Topic service messages (closed, reopened, renamed, pinned) never start a session. Telegram has no way to list topics and sends no update when one is deleted, so the bridge notices deletion when a send fails with `message thread not found`, or by re-applying each topic's open or closed state at start, hourly, and before `/sessions`: an existing topic answers `TOPIC_NOT_MODIFIED`, a deleted one `TOPIC_ID_INVALID`. Two invalid answers in a row are required before anything is ended.

Sessions bound with `/tg-bind` live wherever you started them. Closing or deleting their topic only disconnects Telegram; the session keeps running and its tab keeps its name. Reopening the topic, writing in it, or running `/tg-bind` again reconnects the same topic.

### Where state lives

| What | Where | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Topic bindings, update offset, notice flags | `~/.tg-bridge/state.json` | the bridge |
| Files you sent | `~/.tg-bridge/inbox/<topic>/` | the bridge |
| Session processes and their status | Herdr | Herdr |
| Conversation content | `~/.claude/projects/*/<session>.jsonl` | Claude Code |

## Requirements

- macOS (Linux should work but is untested; `bin/install-launchd` and `caffeinate` are macOS only)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (tested with 1.3.14)
- [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) ([source](https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr), tested with 0.8.0; the installer gets the latest, 0.9.x is untested), with its Claude integration: `herdr integration install claude`
- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs)
- `python3` (Herdr's Claude hook is a Python script) and `curl`

Only sessions started after the Herdr integration is installed can be bridged.

## Manual setup

The installer does all of this for you. These are the same steps by hand, for Linux or a custom setup.

1. **Create a bot.** Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), send `/newbot`, keep the token.
2. **Create a group.** Turn on *Topics* in the group settings (it becomes a supergroup). Add the bot as an admin with **Manage Topics**, **Delete Messages** (for `/delete`) and **Pin Messages** (the status message is pinned). As an admin it receives all messages; no need to change privacy mode.
3. **Find two ids.** Send any message in the group, then open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getUpdates`. `chat.id` (starts with `-100`) is the group id, `from.id` is your user id.
4. **Configure.**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KasparChen/herdr-cc-tg-bridge.git
   cd herdr-cc-tg-bridge
   cp .env.example .env   # fill in the four required values
   ```

   | Variable | Required | Meaning |
   |---|---|---|
   | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | yes | Bot token. Can also come from the environment instead of `.env` |
   | `TG_CHAT_ID` | yes | Group id |
   | `TG_ALLOWED_USERS` | yes | Comma-separated user ids allowed to drive sessions; everyone else is ignored |
   | `TG_BRIDGE_WORKDIR` | yes | Working directory for new sessions (where `CLAUDE.md` is picked up). Use a folder inside your home directory, not the home directory itself: Claude Code asks again on every start whether to trust it |
   | `HERDR_WORKSPACE` | no | Herdr workspace (id or label) for new sessions |
   | `TG_AUTOSEND_EXT` | no | Extensions sent back automatically; `md` and `txt` are off by default |
   | `TG_CLAUDE_ARGS` | no | Extra arguments for `claude` in new sessions |
   | `TG_USAGE_FILE`, `TG_FABLE_USAGE_FILE` | no | JSON files with plan limits to display (format in `.env.example`) |
   | `TG_BRIDGE_LANG` | no | Language of the bot's messages: `en` (default) or `zh` |
   | `TG_BRIDGE_CAFFEINATE` | no | `0` lets the Mac idle-sleep while the bridge runs |

   See [.env.example](.env.example) for the rest.

5. **Run.**

   ```sh
   bin/tg-bridge            # foreground, e.g. in a Herdr tab; Ctrl+C to stop
   bin/install-launchd      # or: start at login on macOS (uninstall with `bin/install-launchd uninstall`)
   bin/tg-bridge status     # local health check
   ```

   `install-launchd` accepts `TG_BRIDGE_LABEL` and `TG_BRIDGE_LAUNCH_PREFIX` (a command put before `bin/tg-bridge`, e.g. a secret injector). If the project lives in a privacy-protected folder such as `~/Desktop`, grant `/bin/bash` Full Disk Access first, or the background job cannot read the files.

6. **Optional: `/tg-bind` in Claude Code.** Create a skill (for example `~/.claude/skills/tg-bind/SKILL.md`) that runs `<repo>/bin/tg-bind` for `/tg-bind` and `<repo>/bin/tg-bind off` for `/tg-bind off`, and tells the session that its replies are now read on a phone. Running `bin/tg-bind` yourself in that pane does the same.

## Usage

| Where | Send | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Anywhere | `/new name` | New topic + new session. Without a name, the topic is renamed after the session's title |
| Anywhere | `/sessions` | All sessions with state, context use and last activity, plus plan limits; one row of buttons each (close / resume / reopen, delete) |
| Anywhere | `/status`, `/help` | Bridge status and plan limits, help |
| In a topic | `/resend` | Send again the parts of the last answer that may not have arrived (😱) |
| Desktop session | `/tg-bind`, `/tg-bind off` | Hand this session over to a new topic, or disconnect it |
| In a topic | Text, photos, files | Delivered to that topic's session |
| In a topic | `/clear` and other slash commands | Passed through to Claude. After `/clear` you are in a fresh context |
| In a topic | `/stop` | Interrupt the current reply |
| In a topic | `/screen` | Last 30 lines of the session's screen |
| In a topic | `/keys down enter` | Send key presses for prompts without buttons |
| In a topic | `/close` | End the session and close the topic; history stays. Closing the topic in the client does the same |
| In a topic | `/delete` | After a confirm button: end the session and delete the topic with all its messages |
| Client | Reopen a closed topic, or write in it | Resume the same session (`claude --resume`) |
| Client | Rename the topic | The Herdr tab is renamed too; the session title no longer overrides it |

The bridge commands are registered in the group's `/` menu. From inside a bridged session:

```sh
bin/tg-send report.pdf chart.png
bin/tg-send --text "done"
```

`tg-send` and `tg-bind` find their pane through `HERDR_PANE_ID`, which Herdr sets in every pane. Sessions opened by the bridge are told about `tg-send` in their system prompt.

## Is the bridge up?

"Online" means both: a Telegram poll succeeded in the last 90 seconds, and the Herdr socket answers. A live process alone is not enough, since it stays alive while the network is down.

| Where | Normally | When stopped or crashed |
|---|---|---|
| Pinned message in the group | Edited in place every 30 s with state, session count, plan limits, last update time; a 🔄 button refreshes it by hand | Turns 🔴 immediately, with the reason |
| `/status` | Same content | No reply |
| Herdr workspace token `tg` | `🟢 <sessions>` | Disappears after 90 s |

While it runs, the bridge keeps the Mac from idle-sleeping. Closing the lid still puts the Mac to sleep. When the computer sleeps nothing can be sent, so the pinned message simply stops updating. If "last update" is more than two minutes old, the bridge or the computer is offline.

Each message you send in a topic carries a reaction showing where it is: 👀 received by the bridge, ✍ taken up by the session (it stays 👀 while queued), 🤔 waiting for your choice, no reaction once the whole answer has arrived. 💔 means it did not reach the session or Telegram refused part of the answer; 😱 means part of the answer got no reply from Telegram and may be missing, and `/resend` in the topic sends those parts again. A message with no reaction at all never reached the bridge. Requests that post something (messages, photos, files, new topics) are never retried after a network failure, because the reply may be what got lost and the bot cannot read the chat to check, so a retry could post the answer twice.

The status is always one message edited in place; a new one is sent only if that message was deleted. A failed edit never sends a replacement, and beats never overlap, so a long network outage or a wake from sleep cannot flood General. While the bridge is abnormal, it stops refreshing after three beats in a row with nothing changed (`TG_STATUS_PAUSE_AFTER`), says so in the message, and resumes on its own when anything changes. The button refreshes it at any time.

## Status of testing

Verified end to end on macOS: text round trips with the progress bubble, photo upload, automatic file return, `tg-send`, `/clear`, title sync, crash recovery with the red status, and launchd restarting a killed supervisor.

The session lifecycle (close, reopen, resume after `/exit` or a closed tab, delete, deleted-topic detection, `/sessions`, `/tg-bind`, context and limit display) was verified through `/sim` and the Bot API. With real Telegram input: creating and renaming a topic by hand, the close button in `/sessions`, and `/delete` with its confirm button.

The installer was tested on macOS against a mocked Bot API, and with dry runs in UTF-8 and C locales, in English and Chinese, run directly and piped through `sh`. It has not yet run end to end on a fresh machine, and the Linux path is untested. The message reactions and `/resend` were verified with a simulated Telegram API; the English bot messages were checked by rendering them.

Not yet verified with real Telegram input: tapping the question buttons, closing or reopening a topic in the client, the 80% context warning, recovery after a real network outage, and starting at an actual reboot.

## Limits

- Files a session creates through scripts are not visible in the transcript; the session has to send them with `tg-send`.
- Bot API limits: downloads up to 20 MB, uploads up to 50 MB. Telegram compresses photos; send as a file for the original.
- Multi-select questions, several questions at once and other prompts are not turned into buttons; use `/keys`.
- Turns without tool calls have no bubble, so they show no context reading; `/sessions` has it.
- Anyone on the allowlist can do whatever the session's permission mode allows, including running commands. Protect your Telegram account.
- Herdr's server must be running (open Herdr once after boot); the bridge does not start it.
- The bot's own messages (status, notices, buttons, the `/` menu) are in English or Chinese, set by `TG_BRIDGE_LANG` (`en` by default; the installer writes the language you ran it in). Other languages need a third string in each `tr()` call in `src/`.

## Development

```sh
bun test                          # unit tests
TG_BRIDGE_SIM=1 bin/tg-bridge     # enable the local simulation endpoint
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' 127.0.0.1:18820/sim -d '{"thread":123,"text":"hello"}'
curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' 127.0.0.1:18820/sim -d '{"callback":"lc:close:123"}'
```

A bot never receives its own messages, so `/sim` (127.0.0.1 only, JSON only, off by default) injects messages and button taps as the first allowed user, and the text of everything the bot sends is echoed to the log. Turn it off when you are done: anything on this machine that can reach the port can drive your sessions while it is on.
